    <p>
      The <strong>TU857 - BSc in Computer Science (Infrastructure)</strong> is a comprehensive and career-focused undergraduate degree offered by <strong>Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin)</strong>. It is tailored for students who are passionate about the backbone of digital systems â€” the infrastructure that supports networks, servers, databases, and cloud services. The course provides a strong foundation in both theoretical knowledge and hands-on experience, preparing students for the evolving demands of the IT industry.
    </p>
<div class="text2"
    <p>
      The programme spans key domains such as:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Networking Fundamentals:</strong> Learn about IP addressing, routing, switching, firewalls, and wireless technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating Systems:</strong> Get trained in both Linux and Windows environments, mastering system configuration and administration.</li>
        <li><strong>Cloud Computing:</strong> Understand the principles of virtualisation, containerisation (e.g., Docker), and platforms like AWS and Azure.</li>
        <li><strong>Cybersecurity:</strong> Explore topics like encryption, intrusion detection systems, firewalls, and ethical hacking.</li>
        <li><strong>Scripting & Automation:</strong> Write shell scripts and automate system processes to improve performance and reduce errors.</li>
        <li><strong>Database Management:</strong> Develop skills in SQL, relational databases, and backup/recovery strategies.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the key strengths of this programme is its emphasis on practical learning. Labs, projects, and real-world scenarios are used extensively to simulate the challenges IT professionals face every day. Students are encouraged to work independently and in teams, fostering collaboration and critical thinking. Industry certifications and professional practice are also embedded within the course structure to boost employability.
    </p>
