        <h2>HKM Fuyad Islam | Cybersecurity & Computer Science Student at TU Dublin</h2>
<div class="text">
        <p>
            Hello! My name is HKM Fuyad Islam, and I am currently an undergraduate student at Technological University Dublin (TU Dublin), where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science with a specialisation in Cybersecurity. I was born in 2005 and originally come from the vibrant country of Bangladesh. In 2025, I made the exciting move to Ireland to follow my passion for technology and build a solid academic foundation in one of Europe's most dynamic and innovative tech environments.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growing up, I was always fascinated by how computers worked — from simple applications to complex networks and security systems. Over time, this curiosity turned into a deep interest in cybersecurity: the art of protecting digital information and infrastructure from threats. At TU Dublin, I have had the opportunity to explore various aspects of computing, including networking, ethical hacking, digital forensics, cloud systems, and information security management.
        </p>

        <p>
            Living and studying in Ireland has been a transformative experience for me. It has not only expanded my academic knowledge but also exposed me to a multicultural environment where I have learned the value of communication, collaboration, and adaptability. As a young student from Bangladesh, I take pride in representing my culture while embracing the global tech community I am now part of.
        </p>

        <p>
            Beyond the classroom, I am constantly seeking new challenges to grow my skills — whether that is through personal projects, online certifications, or collaborating with peers. I am particularly interested in penetration testing, network security, and risk assessment. My long-term goal is to become a cybersecurity professional who can contribute to building safer digital environments for both organizations and individuals.
        </p>

        <p>
            This website is a reflection of my journey — where I share my learning, showcase my work, and connect with others who are passionate about technology and innovation. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out or explore more!
